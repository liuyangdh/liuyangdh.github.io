I am a PhD student in robotics at [LASA](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/), EPFL, supervised by [Prof. Aude Billard](https://people.epfl.ch/aude.billard).

**Research.** Amazed by our human's dexterous, adaptive and yet unconscious sensorimotor skills, my research is about trying to understand such [Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox#:~:text=Moravec's%20paradox%20is%20the%20observation,skills%20require%20enormous%20computational%20resources.), by designing reliable and run-time efficient algorithms for robots. Currently, I am working on robot throwing.

<!-- Fascinated by the [Moravec's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moravec%27s_paradox#:~:text=Moravec's%20paradox%20is%20the%20observation,skills%20require%20enormous%20computational%20resources.) - simply put, sensorimotor skills skills require enormous compute -->

<!-- # Amazed by the dexterity and robustness of human manipulation,  -->

Previously, I did my master’s in [Robotics, Systems and Control](https://master-robotics.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and my bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering at [Jilin University](https://mae.jlu.edu.cn/en/).
