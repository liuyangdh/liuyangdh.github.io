@article{liu2024tube,
  title={Tube acceleration: robust dexterous throwing against release uncertainty},
  abstract={Tube Acceleration is a novel solution concept that drives the robot to stay in the family of object flying trajectories, so that the throwing outcome is robust against release uncertainty. Through insightful observations, Tube Acceleration can be found via convex optimization within 50ms.},
